# Enablement in Action — 3-P Workplace Learning One-Pager
**Presage • Process • Product (3-P) template for GTM teams**

This repo contains a polished, interactive one-pager you can use to design (and pressure-test) enablement and workplace learning initiatives as a **system** — not a session.

If you’ve ever shipped a playbook, workshop, or certification… and seen behaviours revert within weeks, 3-P helps you diagnose what was missing:
- **Presage**: the conditions that make learning possible (or impossible)
- **Process**: the feedback loops that make learning stick
- **Product**: the outcomes + measures that prove impact

Built by **Enablement in Action** (enablementinaction.com).

## 🧩 How teams typically use this
- **Enablement / RevOps**: align on what actually needs to change before launching an initiative
- **Sales Leaders**: define coaching cadence + inspection and link it to performance outcomes
- **Cross-functional GTM**: create shared clarity on audience, process, and measurable impact

---

## 📌 Suggested workflow for sharing (LinkedIn / internal)
- Post a short explanation + screenshot / PDF preview
- Share the GitHub Pages link as the “editable” version
- Encourage users to: **Fill → Print/Save as PDF → Share internally**

---

## ✨ Customisation (brand + layout)
Open `index.html` and edit:
- Colours in the CSS (top of file)
- The header text (title/subtitle)

If you’d like to white-label it for your company:
- Replace “Enablement in Action” text in the header/footer
